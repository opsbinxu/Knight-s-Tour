<h2 style="text-align: center;">Description</h2>

<p>Now that we know where our knight can move, we should have a strategy on how our knight should move. As you saw
    previously, there are often many routes available. We could check every combination of routes possible, but this is
    hard to do by ourselves. In a computer program, we could use brute force to check every possible route combination
    until we find a solution. This is inefficient and could take a while even for a computer to do. How can we determine
    which route gives us the best chance of finishing the puzzle? We can use Warnsdorff's algorithm to help us.</p>

<p>Warnsdorff's algorithm is a strategy for us to choose the best move based off the knight's position and the board's
    status. To apply it:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Check if each 8 of the knight's moves are possible.</li>
    <li>If possible, check how many moves are possible from that landing position.</li>
</ol>

<p>Here is an example of the algorithm:</p>

<p>From the starting position, there are 8 possible moves. The number of next possible moves from each landing spot is
    marked. Here is an example showing how the number of next possible moves is determined. Note that the highest number
    is 7 since you cannot revisit the square you moved from, and the lowest number is 0 which indicates a dead-end.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Objectives</h2>

<p>In this stage, you should alter your program to do the following:</p>

<ol>
    <li>From the starting position, check all 8 possible moving directions.</li>
    <li>If the move is possible, mark the square with how many moves are possible from the landing square.</li>
    <li>If the move is not possible then no action is required.</li>
</ol>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Examples</h2>

<p>The example below shows how your program should work.</p>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by space (<code class="python">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Notice that
    it's not the part of the input.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Enter your board's dimensions: > 6 5
Enter knight's starting position: > 4 2

Here are the possible moves:
 ---------------
5| _ _ _ _ _ _ |
4| _ _ 5 _ 2 _ |
3| _ 5 _ _ _ 3 |
2| _ _ _ X _ _ |
1| _ 2 _ _ _ 1 |
 ---------------
   1 2 3 4 5 6</code></pre>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Enter your board's dimensions: > 3 4
Enter knight's starting position: > 2 2

Here are the possible moves:
 ---------
4| 1 _ 1 |
3| _ _ _ |
2| _ X _ |
1| _ _ _ |
 ---------
   1 2 3</code></pre>

<p><strong>Example 3:</strong></p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Enter your board's dimensions: > 1 2
Enter knight's starting position: > 1 2

Here are the possible moves:
 -----
2| X |
1| _ |
