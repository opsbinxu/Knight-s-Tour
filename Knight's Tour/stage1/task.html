<h2 style="text-align: center;">Description</h2>

<p>The knight's tour problem uses a chessboard and a knight. Don't worry, you won't need to know how to play chess for
    this project, you only need to know how the knight moves.
</p>

<p>A chessboard is an 8 by 8 grid on which the pieces are placed and moved upon. In this project, we will use an (x,y)
    coordinate system to label all the squares where (1,1) is the bottom left, and (8,8) is the top right.</p>

<p>The knight is a special piece in chess. It moves in an L-shape and is able to jump over other pieces. It has to move
    2 squares horizontally and 1 square vertically, or 2 squares vertically and 1 square horizontally.</p>

<p>
    The rules of the knight's tour are as follows:
<ul>
    <li>The knight can start at any square.</li>
    <li>The knight must visit every square by moving in the L-shape.</li>
    <li>The knight can visit each square only once.</li>
    <li>The knight can finish anywhere on the board. This is called an 'open' tour of the board.</li>
    <li>You win if you can visit every square on the board.</li>
    <li>You lose if you haven't visited every square but cannot move your knight without revisiting a square.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Objectives</h2>

<p>Let's get started by setting up the puzzle:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Ask the user for the knight's starting position.</li>
    <li>Display the 8x8 chessboard with the knight in this position. You should display a frame around the board and
        mark the column and row numbers. You should use <code class="python">_</code> for an empty cell with a space in between, and an <code class="python">X</code> for the
        knight's position.</li>
</ol>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Examples</h2>

<p>The example below shows how your program should work.</p>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by space (<code class="python">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Notice that
    it's not the part of the input.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Enter knight's starting position: &gt; 1 3
