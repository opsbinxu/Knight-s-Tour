<h2 style="text-align: center;">Description</h2>

<p>Although this puzzle is based on chess, you can actually try this puzzle on any sized board. The dimensions of the
    board are not constrained to an 8x8 grid. You can try smaller boards like 5x5, rectangular boards like 4x8, even
    non-rectangular boards with missing squares! To make things simple, we will only focus on rectangular boards. Note,
    the board is guaranteed to have a solution if the smallest dimension is at least 5. Smaller boards are not
    guaranteed to have a solution.
</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Objectives</h2>

<p>In this stage, you should alter your program to do the following:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Ask the user for the board's dimensions. The order of the values should be x columns and y rows.</li>
    <li>After taking the starting position, check that it is a valid position.</li>
    <li>If it is invalid, you should show an error message Invalid position!, then prompt the user for another starting
        position until the user enters a valid position.</li>
    <li>Draw the board with the knight.</li>
</ol>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Examples</h2>

<p>The example below shows how your program should work.</p>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by space (<code class="python">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Notice that
    it's not the part of the input.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Enter your board's dimensions: &gt; 6 5
Enter knight's starting position: &gt; 4 2
 ---------------
5| _ _ _ _ _ _ |

3| _ _ _ _ _ _ |
2| _ _ _ X _ _ |
1| _ _ _ _ _ _ |
