<h2 style="text-align: center;">Description</h2>

<p>This puzzle is too hard! Let's modify our program to give us the solution instead.</p>

<p>Note, not all boards have a possible solution, even if they are rectangular. Any rectangular with a minimum dimension
    of 5 are guaranteed to at least have an open tour solution. Smaller boards are not guaranteed to have solutions.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Objectives</h2>

<p>In this stage, you should alter your program to do the following:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Set up the board as before.</li>
    <li>Ask the player if they want to try the puzzle or see the solution.</li>
    <li>If they want to try the puzzle, check if there is a solution. If there is no solution, print No solution exists!
        and end the game. Otherwise, let the player try the puzzle like in the previous stage.</li>
    <li>If they want to see the solution, check if there is a solution. If there is no solution, print No solution
        exists! . If there is a solution, you should label the starting point as 1, then label each move with the next
        number until you visit all the squares. The highest number displayed should be the number of squares on the
        board.</li>
    <li>If the numbers have less digits than the highest number (e.g. 5 only has 1 digit, but 12 has 2 digits), you
        should use a space for the extra digits and right-align the numbers.</li>
</ol>

<p>Hint: The most intuitive method for the solution finder is to use recursion and backtracking. The recursive function
    should check the best possible move based on Warnsdorff's algorithm. The function should call itself from this new
    position, and continue to call itself until it there are no more possible moves. If you've visited all the squares
    then you've got a solution. If not, you've reached a dead end and need to go back to the previous square and check
    the next best possible move. Also note that bigger boards take much longer to solve.</p>
    
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Examples</h2>

<p>The example below shows how your program should work.</p>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by space (<code class="python">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Notice that
    it's not the part of the input.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Enter your board's dimensions: > 4 4
Enter knight's starting position: > 2 2
Do you want to try the puzzle? (y/n): > n
No solution exists!</code></pre>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Enter your board's dimensions: > 4 4
Enter knight's starting position: > 2 2
Do you want to try the puzzle? (y/n): > y
No solution exists!</code></pre>

<p><strong>Example 3:</strong></p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Enter your board's dimensions: > 5 4
Enter knight's starting position: > 1 4
Do you want to try the puzzle? (y/n): > y

Enter your next move: 2 4
